# Contributing

Optimally, when contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an [issue](https://github.com/GIScience/ohsome-examples/issues/new), [email](mailto:ohsome@heigit.org), or any other method with the [owners](https://github.com/orgs/GIScience/teams/ohsome/members) of this repository before making a change.

## Content and Aims of This Repository

This _examples_ repository is meant to be a collection of curated examples for how to request and use the [ohsome-api](https://github.com/giscience/ohsome-api) effectively. The individual examples should be well documented, easy to follow and be composed of reusable building-blocks. Ideally, every example should be self-contained and not repeat concepts which are already shown in another example. The focus is more on showcasing the technical concepts and usage patterns rather than on the data analysis side of things (although it is of course best when it is possible to combine all of this).

The project's readme also includes a list of examples where the ohsome API is used in real world applications and data analyses. Free free to propose to have your project added to the list.

## Pull Request Process

All changes to this repository should go through pull requests, and require:

1. Ensure that changes are working and don't break other examples (e.g. after updating dependencies).
2. Update the `README.md`s when adding new examples.
3. If an example requires external libraries: Ensure that these are properly documented and included in the requirements definitions file (e.g. `requirements.txt` for Python examples).
